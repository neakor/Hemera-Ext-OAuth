## Introdction

Hemera is a high-performance, lightweight, RESTful consumer server application
development platform based on the Java SE platform. It aims to help consumer
application developers to focus on their application specific logic development
without having to worry about the low level system details.

Hemera is designed to have an extremely low learning curve, so you can start working
on your application as quickly as possible, and iterate as often as possible. At the
same time, Hemera provides guidance and enforcements to application server
architecture through its application extension interface, to help improve software
mainability and scalability.
